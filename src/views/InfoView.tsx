        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
        newly discovered coronavirus.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
        moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
        treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
        cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
        cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed
        about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
        Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or
        using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
        discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so
        itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
        example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.
        However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential
        treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as
        clinical findings become available.
